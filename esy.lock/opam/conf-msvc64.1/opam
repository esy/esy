synopsis: "Microsoft C Compiler Environment Settings (64-bit x86_64)"
description: """
This package uses msvs-tools to find additional values required for the
environment in order to use the x86_64 (64-bit) Microsoft C compiler (cl).

After installation, the package's variables indicate the required values:
- conf-msvc64:msvs-bin, conf-msvc64:msvs-inc and conf-msvc64:msvc-lib are values
  to be added to PATH, INCLUDE and LIB respectively. In opam 2.2, they should be
  added using x-env-path-rewrite set to false, as they contain multiple
  directories.
- conf-msvc64:package is the name of the Visual Studio package providing the
  compiler (e.g. Visual Studio Community 2022)
- conf-msvc64:ml is the name of the assembler (usually "ml64")
- conf-msvc64:script is the vcvarsall or setenv script which was queried by
  msvs-detect to provide this information

synopsis: "OCaml for Microsoft Visual Studio"
description: """
This package is installed if the underlying OCaml compiler is one of the "MSVC"
native Windows ports of OCaml.

Precisely, this means `ocamlopt -config-var system` is equal to either `win32`
or `win64`.

This package may be used in depends or conflicts fields of dependent packages
to indicate either a requirement or an incompatibility with this OCaml port."""

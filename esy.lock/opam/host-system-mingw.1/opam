synopsis: "OCaml for mingw-w64"
description: """
This package is installed if the underlying OCaml compiler is one of the
mingw-w64 native Windows ports of OCaml.

Precisely, this means `ocamlopt -config-var system` is equal to either `mingw`
or `mingw64`.

This package may be used in depends or conflicts fields of dependent packages
to indicate either a requirement or an incompatibility with this OCaml port."""

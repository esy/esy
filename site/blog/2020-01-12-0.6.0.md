title: New release - 0.6.0 ðŸŽ‰
---

We went quite again for a while with the blog - between the last post, we released 0.5.* and now 0.6.0.

This time received contributions from 28 contributors! Thank you
everyone! Let's take a quick look at what new in 0.6.0.

### esy cleanup

We added a sub-command `cleanup` to reclaim disk space by purging
unused builds. Over time, cached builds would just accumulate in
`~/.esy` and the only way to reclaim space was to delete it
entirely. Users had no way of knowing which cached builds were in use
by projects and would end up seeing long build times again after deleting the the cached directory.

`esy cleanup` takes in a list of projects in use as arguments and
removes all cached builds not needed by any of them:

    $ esy cleanup ./project/in/use ./another/project

See [docs][esy-cleanup-reference] for more information.

### Improved solver performance with better CUDF encoding

We re-worked how we encode dependencies which improved solver
performance, fixed [critical bug](https://github.com/esy/esy/issues/883). More on this can found at issue [#888](https://github.com/esy/esy/issues/888)

### Recursive fetching of submodules, when building packages from source

As a move towards ensuring better compatibility with opam, we
recursively fetch submodules when fetching from git sources.

Now esy can install and build packages from git/github even if they depend on
submodules.

### Long paths on Windows

We were earlier constrained to only use 33 characters in the
artifact paths in our binaries on Windows - this caused
relocatability issues and delayed our plans of fetching prebuilts
for esy sandbox. With this release, esy now enables long paths on
supported Windows machines and brings back relocatability (and
there shorted build times with prebuilts) back on the table.

### Other Notable fixes

Besides that 0.6.0 contains fixes for not a small number of bugs, many doc
updates and small quality-of-life improvements. Some things worth mentioning:

  - More robust project discovery
  - Improved git source parsing
  - Test suite improvements
  - New command esy run-script SCRIPTNAME which provides a future proof way of
    running package.json scripts

The entire changelog can be found [here][CHANGELOG].

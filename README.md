## Workflow

To make changes to `esy` and test them locally:

```
% git clone git://github.com/esy/esy.git
% cd esy # Change to the cloned directory
% esy # install and build dependencies 
```

And then run newly built `esy` executable from anywhere by adding `PATH_TO_REPO/_build/install/default/bin`
to the $PATH during the shell's session. On Windows, append `PATH_TO_REPO/bin` too.

### Updating `bin/esyInstallRelease.js`

`bin/esyInstallRelease.js` is developed separately within the `esy-install-npm-release/` directory.

Run:

```
% make bin/esyInstallRelease.js
```

to update the `bin/esyInstallRelease.js` file with the latest changed, don't
forget to commit it.

### Running Tests

Run:

```
% make test
```

#### Windows

In cases e2e tests fail with `Host key verification failed.`, you might have to create ssh keys
in the cygwin shall and add them to your github profile.

1. Enter cygwin installed by esy (not the global one)

```sh
.\node_modules\esy-bash\re\_build\default\bin\EsyBash.exe bash
```

2. Generate ssh keys

```sh
ssh-keygen
```

3. Add the public key to you Github profile

4. Add the following to the bash rc of the cygwin instance

```sh
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```


### Branches

There are two branches:

- `master` — the active development, we cut new versions out of there regularly.
- `0.0.x` — maintainance branch for 0.0.x releases.
- `0.2.x` — maintainance branch for 0.2.x releases.
- `0.3.x` — maintainance branch for 0.3.x releases.

## Workflow for esy.sh

To make changes to [esy.sh][]:

1. Bootstrap site's dev environment:

  ```
  % make site-bootstrap
  ```

2. Run site locally:

  ```
  % make site-start
  ```

3. When you are happy with the changes:

  ```
  % make site-publish
  ```

## Issues

Issues are tracked at [esy/esy][].

## Publishing Releases

esy is released on npm.

Because esy is written in OCaml/Reason and compiled into a native executable we
need to acquire a set of prebuilt binaries for each supported platform (Windows,
macOS and Linux). We employ CI servers (thanks Azure) to build platform specific
releases.

The release workflow is the following:

1.  Ensure you are on `master` branch and assuming you want to release the
    version currently defined in `package.json` (see step 6.), run

    ```
    % make release-tag
    % git push && git push --tags
    ```

2.  Wait till CI finishes its task and release `@esy-nightly/esy` package.

    You can test it manually.

3.  Run

    ```
    % make release-prepare
    ```

    which downloads the nightly corresponding to the current commit working
    directory is at and "promotes" it to a release. It will create
    `_release/package` directory.

4.  Ensure release inside `_release/package` directory is ok.

    You can `cd _release/package && npm pack && npm install -g ./esy-*.tgz` to test how
    release installs and feels.

5.  Run

    ```
    % make release-publish
    ```

    to upload the release on npm.

    Use

    ```
    % make NPM_RELEASE_TAG=next release-publish
    ```

    to publish the release under `next` tag (so users won't get it automatically but
    only explicitly requested).

6.  Bump version in `package.json` to the next patch version.

    We expect the next version to be mostly a patch version. In case you
    want to release new minor or major version you need to bump it before the
    release.

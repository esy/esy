# esy

`package.json` workflow for native development with Reason/OCaml

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/esy-dev/esy/_apis/build/status/build)](https://dev.azure.com/esy-dev/esy/_build/latest?definitionId=1)

Esy is a package manager for Reason and OCaml centered around the [NPM] workflow. Reason/OCaml are compiled languages and it can be daunting for developers to setup tools and develop a workflow that is intuitive and well documented. Developing apps that are natively compiled are also hard to reproduce and often require additional tooling. Esy tries address these, by offering a familiar `package.json` centered workflow and light-weight sandboxing.

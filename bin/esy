  install               Installs packages declared in package.json.
  i

  build                 Builds everything that needs to be built, caches
  b                     results. Builds according to each package's "esy"
                        entry in package.json. Before building each package,
                        the environment is scrubbed clean then created according
                        to dependencies.

  build <command>       Builds everything that needs to be build, caches
  b <command>           results. Then runs a command inside the root package's
                        build environment.

  shell                 The same as esy build-shell, but creates a "relaxed"
                        environment - meaning it also inherits your existing
                        shell.

  add <package>         Add a specified package to dependencies and installs it.

  release TYPE          Create a release of type TYPE ("dev", "pack" or "bin").

  print-env             Prints esy environment on stdout.

  build-shell [path]    Drops into a shell with environment matching your
                        package's build environment. If argument is provided
                        then it should point to the package inside the current
                        sandbox — that will initialize build shell for that
                        specified package.

  build-eject           Creates node_modules/.cache/esy/build-eject/Makefile,
                        which is later can be used for building without the NodeJS
                        runtime.

                        Unsupported form: build-eject [cygwin | linux | darwin]
                        Ejects a build for the specific platform. This
                        build-eject form is not officially supported and will
                        be removed soon. It is currently here for debugging
                        purposes.

  install-cache         Manage installation cache (similar to 'yarn cache'
                        command).

  import-opam           Read a provided opam file and print esy-enabled
                        package.json conents on stdout. Example:

                          esy import-opam lwt 3.0.0 ./opam

  config ls|get         Query esy configuration.

  help                  Print this message.

  version               Print esy version and exit

  <command>             Executes <command> as if you had executed it inside of
                        esy shell.

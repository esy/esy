  install               Installs packages declared in package.json.

  build                 Builds everything that needs to be built, caches
                        results. Builds according to each package's "esy"
                        entry in package.json. Before building each package,
                        the environment is scrubbed clean then created according
                        to dependencies.

  shell                 The same as esy build-shell, but creates a "relaxed"
                        environment - meaning it also inherits your existing
                        shell.

  release TYPE          Create a release of type TYPE ("dev", "pack" or "bin").

  print-env             Prints esy environment on stdout.

  build-shell           Drops into a shell with environment matching your
                        package's build environment.

  build-eject           Creates node_modules/.cache/esy/build-eject/Makefile,
                        which is later can be used for building without the NodeJS
                        runtime.

                        Unsupported form: build-eject [cygwin | linux | darwin]
                        Ejects a build for the specific platform. This
                        build-eject form is not officially supported and will
                        be removed soon. It is currently here for debugging
                        purposes.


  import-opam           Read a provided opam file and print esy-enabled
                        package.json conents on stdout. Example:

                          esy import-opam lwt 3.0.0 ./opam

  <command>             Executes <command> as if you had executed it inside of
                        esy shell.

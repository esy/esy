(** Logging.

    [Esy_logs] provides a basic logging infrastructure. {{!func}Logging}
    is performed on {{!srcs}sources} whose reporting
    {{!type:level}level} can be set independently. Log message
    report is decoupled from logging and handled by a
    {{!reporters}reporter}.

    See the {{!basics}basics}, a few {{!usage}usage conventions} to
    respect and a note on {{!sync}synchronous logging}.

    Log {{!srcs}sources} have an optional {{!Src.level}reporting level}. If
    the level is [Some l] then any message whose level is smaller or
    equal to [l] is reported. If the level is [None] no message is
    ever reported. *)

    it will block until the message has been formatted on the channel

    {2:logging Logging}

    In order to minimize the overhead whenever a log message is not reported,
    message formatting only occurs on actual message report via the
    {{!msgf}message formatting function} you provide to log functions. This
    leads to the following logging structure:
{[
let k, v = ... in
Esy_logs.err (fun m -> m "invalid kv (%a,%a)" pp_key k pp_val v);
Esy_logs.err (fun m -> m "NO CARRIER");
]}
    The pattern is quite simple: it is as if you were formatting with
    a [printf]-like function except you get this function in the [m]
    argument of the function you give to the logging function.

    If you want to abstract a repeated log report it is better to keep
    the message formatting function structure for the arguments of the
    messages. Here's how the above examples can be abstracted and
    invoked:
{[
let err_invalid_kv args =
  Esy_logs.err @@ fun m ->
  args (fun k v -> m "invalid kv (%a,%a)" pp_key k pp_val v)

let err_no_carrier args =
  Esy_logs.err @@ fun m -> args (m "NO CARRIER")

let () =
  err_invalid_kv (fun args -> args "key" "value");
  err_no_carrier (fun () -> ());
  ()
]}
    Note that log messages are formatted and hit the reporter only if
    they have not been filtered out by the current
    {{!Src.level}reporting level} of the source you log on. See also
    the log source and reporting level {{!usage}usage conventions}.

    {2:setupreporter Reporter setup}

    If you are writing an application you must remember to
    {{!set_reporter}set} the reporter before any logging operation
    takes place otherwise no messages will be reported. For example if
    you are using the {{!Esy_logs_fmt}formatter reporter}, logging
    can be setup as follows:
{[
let main () =
  Esy_logs.set_reporter (Esy_logs_fmt.reporter ());
  ...
  exit (if Esy_logs.err_count () > 0 then 1 else 0);
  ()
]}
    If you have logging code that is performed in the toplevel
    initialization code of modules (not a good idea) or you depend on
    (bad) libraries that do so, you must call and link the reporter
    install code before these initialization bits are being executed
    otherwise you will miss these messages.

    In multi-threaded programs you likely want to ensure mutual
    exclusion on reporter access. This can be done by invoking
    {!Esy_logs.set_reporter_mutex} with suitable mutual exclusion
    primitives. If you use OCaml {!Thread}s simply calling
    {!Esy_logs_threaded.enable} with handle that for you.

    If you need to use multiple reporters in your program see this
    {{!ex2}sample code}.

    The documentation of {!Esy_logs_cli} module has a {{!Esy_logs_cli.ex}full setup
    example} that includes command line options to control color and log
    reporting level.

    If you are writing a library you should neither install reporters, nor
    set the reporting level of sources, nor log on the {!default} source or
    at the [App] level; follow the {{!usage}the usage conventions}. A
    library should simply log on another existing source or define
    its own source like in the example below:
{[
let src = Esy_logs.Src.create "mylib.network" ~doc:"esy_logs mylib's network events"
module Log = (val Esy_logs.src_log src : Esy_logs.LOG)
]}
    The [Log] module defines logging functions that are specific to the
    source [src].

    {1:usage Usage conventions}

    A library should never log on the {!default} source or at the
    [App] level these are reserved for use by the application. It
    should either create a source for itself or log on the source
    defined by one of its dependencies. It should also never set the
    reporting level of the sources it deals with or install reporters since
    control over this must be left to the application.

    The semantics of {{!type:level}reporting levels} should be understood
    as follows:
    {ul
    {- [App], this level can be used for the standard output or console
       of an application. It should never be used by libraries.}
    {- [Error], error condition that prevent the program from
       running normally.}
    {- [Warning], suspicious condition that does not prevent the
       program from running normally but may eventually lead to an
       error condition.}
    {- [Info], condition that allows the program {e user} to get a better
       understanding of what the program is doing.}
    {- [Debug], condition that allows the program {e developer} to get a
       better undersanding of what the program is doing.}}

    {1:sync Note on synchronous logging}

    In synchronous logging, a client call to a log function proceeds
    only once the reporter has finished the report operation. In
    [Esy_logs] this depends both on the reporter and the log functions
    that the client uses.

    Whenever the client uses a log function that results in a report,
    it gives the reporter a continuation that defines the result type
    of the log function and a callback to be called whenever the log
    operation is over from the reporter's perspective (see {!type:reporter}).
    The typical use of the callback is to unblock the continuation given
    to the reporter. This is used by {!Esy_logs_lwt}'s log functions to make
    sure that the threads they return proceed only once the report is over.
    In the functions of {!Esy_logs} however the callback does nothing as there
    is no way to block the polymorphic continuation.

    Now considering reporters, at the extreme we have:
    {ul
    {- A completely asynchronous reporter. This reporter formats the
       message in memory and immediately invoke the callback followed
       by the continuation. This provides no guarantee of persistency
       in case a crash occurs. All log functions behave asynchronously
       and return as soon as possible.}
    {- A completely synchronous reporter. This reporter formats the
       message, persist it, invoke the client callback followed by the
       continuation. All log functions behave synchronously. An
       example of such a reporter is {!Esy_logs_fmt.reporter} with
       formatters baked by channels: when formatting returns the
       message has been written on the channel.}}

    However a purely synchronous reporter like {!Esy_logs_fmt.reporter}
    acting on channels does not play well with [Lwt]'s cooperative
    runtime system. It is possible to reuse {!Esy_logs_fmt.reporter} to
    define a cooperative reporter, see {{!Esy_logs_lwt.report_ex}this
    example}. However while this reporter makes {!Esy_logs_lwt}'s log
    functions synchronous, those of {!Esy_logs} behave asynchronously. For
    now it seems it that this is unfortunately the best we can do if
    we want to preserve the ability to use [Esy_logs] with or without
    cooperative concurency.

    {1:ex1 Example with custom reporter and tags}

    This example uses a {{!Tag}tag} to attach {!Mtime} time spans in
    log messages. The custom reporter uses these time spans to format
    relative timings for runs of a given function. Note that as done
    below the timings do include logging time.
{[
let stamp_tag : Mtime.span Esy_logs.Tag.def =
  Esy_logs.Tag.def "stamp" ~doc:"Relative monotonic time stamp" Mtime.Span.pp

let stamp c = Esy_logs.Tag.(empty |> add stamp_tag (Mtime_clock.count c))

    {1:ex2 Logging to multiple reporters}

    Logging to multiple reporters can be achieved by defining a new reporter
    that simply forwards to them. The following example combines
    two reporters:
{[
let combine r1 r2 =
  let report = fun src level ~over k msgf ->
    let v = r1.Esy_logs.report src level ~over:(fun () -> ()) k msgf in
    r2.Esy_logs.report src level ~over (fun () -> v) msgf
  in
  { Esy_logs.report }

let () =
  let r1 = Esy_logs.format_reporter () in
  let r2 = Esy_logs_fmt.reporter () in
  Fmt_tty.setup_std_outputs ();
  Esy_logs.set_reporter (combine r1 r2);
  Esy_logs.err (fun m -> m "HEY HO!");
  ()
]}
